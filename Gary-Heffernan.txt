    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github?
    git push -u origin branch-name

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow.
      1. Fork the relevant repository.
      2. Check to see that the fork was successful. The fork was succesful
      if your name is in front of the repository.
      3. Add the Team Lead on the forked rep by going to setting ->
      collaborators --> add collaborators
      4. Clone the repository using the green clone or download button.
      5. Using your command line, us cd to go to the directory where you
      want to clone your forked repository.
      6. Use the git clone <link to repo> command to clone the repo to the
      directory you are currently in.
      7. Use cd command to change directory's to the newly created directory.
      8. Use the git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname' command to create a branch.
      Use this branch for your work.
      9. Now you can add work to the repository and complete the project assignment.
      10. Use git add . to add the repo changes and make them ready for committing
      11. Use git commit -m "commit message" to commit the changes with your
      specified commit message. Commit message is used to explain what changes
      you've added to the repository that you are committing.
      12. Now it's time to push your changes back up to the Github repo. Use the
      following command: git push -u origin branch-name to push all commits from
      your local machine up onto github. branch-name in this example is firstname-lastname.
      13. Now the changes are on github so you can submit a pull request.
      14. Go back to the forked copy on github (not the original lambda one) and:
        a. Click on Branch:master button on the left side. This creates a drop-down.
        b. Use the drop-down to select your branch.
        c. Click new pull request to make a pull request on your name branch.
        d. You will get redirected to the pull request page.
        e. On the pull request page, click the dropdown that says base repository
        and change it to your forked repository (i.e. not the lambda one).
        f. Add your Team Lead to the Reviewers.
        g. Submit the pull request.
      15. Do not merge your own pull request. This will be done by your team lead.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Block elements are usually structural while inline elements are usually text.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    An absolutely positioned element is taken out of the flow. Other elements
    are positioned as if the absolutely positioned element did not exist.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    You can use the box-sizing property along with the width property to specify
    a width and have the element maintain that width.


    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    Block by default: <p>, <li>, <div>
    Inline by default: <a>, <span>
    Block inline by default: <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
    The box model is a set of rules that describes how to arrange the five spacing properties of all
    HTML block-level elements. The five spacing properties are: height, width,
    margin, border and padding. Height represents the height of the box, width
    the width of the box, margin the space between the box and the border, border
    the inner border around the text element, and padding the space between the
    text element and the border.
    The problem with the box model is that padding and borders add to an elements width.
    This can be difficult to deal with. The fix for the box model is box-sizing:border-box.
    This includes padding and borders in an element's width.
